# CGPSC React + Tailwind (Blue Template)

This project is a React + Tailwind (Vite) starter app for a Chhattisgarh Public Service Commission (CGPSC) website — blue-themed demo with pages for Home, About, Examinations, Notifications, Results, Recruitment, Downloads, RTI, Services, Tenders, and Contact.

---

## Quick setup (local)

1. Unzip or clone the project and open a terminal in the project folder:

```bash
cd cgpsc-react-tailwind
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

---

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
# preview the production build locally
npm run preview
```

The production files will be in the `dist/` directory after `npm run build`.

---

## Tailwind note

This project already includes `tailwind.config.cjs` and `postcss.config.cjs`. If you change Tailwind versions or want to reinitialize, run:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

But this is **not required** for the provided scaffold because config files are included.

---

## Deploying

### Netlify
1. Create a new site on Netlify and connect your Git repository (or drag & drop the `dist/` folder after building).
2. Set the build command: `npm run build` and the publish directory: `dist`.
3. Deploy.

### Vercel
1. Import the Git repository into Vercel.
2. Framework: **Vite** (auto-detected) — build command: `npm run build`, output directory: `dist`.
3. Deploy.

### GitHub Pages (simple approach)
1. Install `gh-pages` as a dev dependency and add deployment scripts:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
# package.json scripts:
#   "predeploy": "npm run build",
#   "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
```

2. Push to GitHub and run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This publishes the `dist/` folder to `gh-pages` branch (GitHub Pages).

## Customize

- Modify colors in `tailwind.config.cjs` or the small CSS variables in `src/index.css`.
- Add API integration (contact form, notifications) by creating a backend endpoint and calling it from the pages (e.g., `src/pages/Contact.jsx`).
- Add authentication or admin dashboard as needed.
